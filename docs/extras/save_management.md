# Save management

For save management, [Checkpoint](https://github.com/flagbrew/checkpoint/releases) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. 

Please read Checkpoint's [usage page](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint#usage) for information on how to use it.
