2. Navigate to `Partition the SD` and press the A button to enter the SD format menu.
	- If you can't find the Partition the SD option, make sure that your microSD Card is inserted and select Mount SD.
3. Navigate to `FAT32 + emuMMC` and press the A button to confirm.
4. Read the warning, and select Yes to partition & format your microSD Card.
	- Note: This will delete all data on your microSD Card. Make sure you backed up your Nintendo folder!
	- This should not take more than a few seconds.

!!! warning "Windows complaining about an unreadable drive"
    If you get the issue that Windows says the microSD Card is unreadable and wants to format it, do not format! This is likely your emuMMC partition. After partitioning your sd, your sd will show up as 2 drives on your PC. Use the drive that can be accessed
