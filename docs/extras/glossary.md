# Glossary of common hacking terms

This section is dedicated to explaining a number of common terms that are used when hacking the Nintendo Switch as well as linking a number of resources that can help fledgling developers or curious users.

## Hacking terms

The following list is in alphabetical order.

- **90DNS**: DNS that blocks system updates on the Nintendo Switch. This can be enabled by following the guide [here](blocking_nintendo.md).
- **[Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)**: The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide.
- **autoRCM**: This refers to an environment where the Switch boots into RCM automatically, without the need of a jig. Please see [this page](/autorcm.md) for more info.
- **boot0 / boot1**: Two partitions of the Switch NAND that the console verifies in order to boot into the Switch OS.
- **CFW**: Short for custom firmware. Custom firmware permits you to completely modify how your Switch works.
- **Deja Vu**: An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1.
- **DNS**: [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). Basically, it's the internet's addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS is what tells you what server the site is hosted on.
- **Dongle**: Device you can plug in the charging port of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM.
- **Encryption keys**: Keys used to encrypt files from the Nintendo Switch. These can be dumped by following the guide [here](dumping_title_keys.md).
  - **BIS keys**: Specific keys used to decrypt the NAND.
- **Erista**: Also referred to as **T210** or **V1**, this refers to the original chipset used on full-sized Switch consoles manufactured before mid-2018, before the better-battery Switch. Erista units can be patched or unpatched.
- **[fusee-gelee](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher/blob/master/report/fusee_gelee.md)/[ShofEL2](https://github.com/fail0verflow/shofel2)**: Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootROM access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1s RCM and permits us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device and a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while ShofEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee.
- **[hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool)**: Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files.
- **[Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate)**: A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosphere to boot CFW.
- **Homebrew**: Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit.
- **Homebrew launcher**: Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew.
- **Horizon**: Also referred to as **HOS** or **HorizonNX**, this refers to the official name of the Switch operating system. Horizon is also the name of the 3DS's OS, which HorizonNX is based off of.
- **Jig**: Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joy-Con rail to enter RCM.
- **KIP**: Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality.
- **Mariko**: Also referred to as **T214** or **V2**, refers to the chipset of any console made after late-2019. This includes Switch Lite, Switch (OLED Model), and the better-battery Switch. Units using Mariko chipsets are unhackable via software for the foreseeable future.
- **NAND**: The internal filesystem used by the Switch. Contains boot0 and boot1, as well as PRODINFO and various other partitions.
- **NAND Backup**: A complete snapshot of the internal storage from a particular point in time. These are useful for brick recovery and to retrieve individual files from.
- **nx-hbloader**: Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere.
- **PRODINFO**: A crucial partition on the NAND of your Switch. Atmosphere backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup. Losing/corrupting this file will permanently prevent a Switch from booting and/or connecting to Nintendo servers.
- **ReSwitched**: A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosphere.
- **RCM**: A shorthand for "Recovery Mode". This commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the Joy-Con controller. Ways of pressing this button can be found [here](../user_guide/emummc/entering_rcm.md).
- **[TegraRCMGUI](https://github.com/eliboa/TegraRcmGUI/releases)/[fusee-interface-tk](https://github.com/nh-server/fusee-interfacee-tk/releases)**: Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch.
- **Tegra X1**: A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch. There are two main revisions, [documented here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra#Tegra_X1)
- **Trinket**: A tiny chip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload upon RCM detection.
- **TrustZone**: The highest security level on the Switch.
- **XCI/NSP**: Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles. Neither should be installed if you plan to go online to Nintendo servers.
