# Save management

For save management, [Checkpoint](https://github.com/flagbrew/checkpoint/releases) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. 

[Edizon](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases) is also a save manager but has the ability to edit saves for extra items etc.

### Chekpoint
