# Save Management

For save management, [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. 

[Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint) is also a save manager. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. It also has the ability to share save data over FTP and WiFi.
Note that the normal release is currently broken and you should use [this fork](https://github.com/SciresM/Checkpoint/releases/) instead.
