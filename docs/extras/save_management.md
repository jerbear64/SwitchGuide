For save management, [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. 

[Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint) is also a save manager. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. It also has the ability to share save data over FTP and WiFi.
