# Blocking Updates

You can add custom DNS to your Wifi connection that will block all communication with the Nintendo servers. This will stop any updates and reporting to Nintendo, but it will prevent use of the eShop and online games.

We will be using 90DNS, a community-run custom DNS.

### Instructions
