# Save Management

For save management, [Checkpoint](https://github.com/flagbrew/checkpoint/releases) is recommended. It can be used to back up and restore game saves to your SD card. 

[Edizon](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases) is also a save manager but has the ability to edit saves for extra items etc. It also has support for Atmosphere's cheat engine, providing an easy way to download new cheats, as well as toggle them on or off.
